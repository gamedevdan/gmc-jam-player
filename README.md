# gmc-jam-player
A player/randomiser for the GMC Jam

This is a randomiser for the GMC Jam- https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?forums/gmc-jam.9/
The host can create a CSV file of all the entries and their download links and this executable will spit them out in a random order,
allow players to rank the games, write reviews and export their posts for use in GMC Jam voting topics.

The current build makes use of execute_shell_simple by YellowAfterLife to open URLs

Thanks,
